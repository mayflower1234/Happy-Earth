<h1> Solution</h1>
<p> We would send drom to the site to take all the pictures and with some tools to take samples around the area as need it.
Second after looking at the pictures try to find a solution. 
For an example buld a machine that collects water from the flood locations and then take it to the area where wild fire happens and store the machine at the site.</p>
