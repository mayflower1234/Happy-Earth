 <h1> Problem and a reason</h1>
<p> First let's find out the sites where is the natural disasters are happening around the earth and how many times a year</p>
 Wildfires happens because of heat and not enough rain. For example; in California there were wildfires for three days and within las two days; topical stome came in and help the sitution come down, and this is one of many example of natural disasters. For more information please see the database. <!California's Nightmare Fire Season Continues. (n.d.).

<h1> Solution</h1>
<p> We would send drom to the site to take all the pictures and with some tools to take samples around the area as need it.
Second after looking at the pictures try to find a solution. 
For an example buld a machine that collects water from the flood locations and then take it to the area where wild fire happens and store the machine at the site.</p>
